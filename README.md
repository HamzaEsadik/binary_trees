## Introduction
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. These structures are widely used in computer science for various applications, such as search operations, expression trees, and hierarchical representation of data.

## Binary Tree Basics
The binary_tree.c file contains a basic implementation of a binary tree in C. This includes the definition of a Node structure and functions for basic tree operations, such as insertion and deletion.

## Traversal Techniques
Understanding how to traverse a binary tree is crucial. The traversal.c file provides implementations for three common traversal techniques in C: in-order, pre-order, and post-order. These functions help you explore the nodes of the tree in different orders.

## Binary Search Trees
A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree that maintains the property that the key in each node must be greater than or equal to any key stored in the left sub-tree and less than or equal to any key stored in the right sub-tree. Explore the bst.c file to see how BSTs are implemented in C and how they differ from regular binary trees.

## Common Operations
The operations.c file includes additional operations commonly performed on binary trees in C, such as finding the height, checking if a tree is balanced, and searching for a specific element.
